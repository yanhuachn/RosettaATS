Best Shuffle

# Problem: http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Best_shuffle

!!! Attention

I didn't read the problem carefully, misunderstanding it as a slightly different
problem, so this solution is for a slightly different problem.
I define the shuffle in my code to be "rotate", which means the order of the char
sequence cannot be changed.
So this code should be RENAMEd as "best_rotation".
